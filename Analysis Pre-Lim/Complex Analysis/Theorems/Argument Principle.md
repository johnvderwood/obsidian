Let $f$ be meromorphic in a simply connected domain $D\subset \mathbb{C}$ and let $\gamma$ be a positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple closed contour in $D$ such that 
	1. $f$ has no zeros or poles on $\gamma$.
	2. $f$ is analytic on the interior of $\gamma$ except possibly at finitely many poles.
Then we have:
$$
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz = \# \text{ zeros in the interior of $\gamma$} - \# \text{ poles in the interior of $\gamma$}
$$
