A function $f$ defined in a deleted neighborhood of $z_0$ has a pole at $z_0$ if the function $g(z)=\frac{1}{f(z)}$, defined to be 0 at $z_0$, is holomorphic in a full neighborhood of $z_0$. Equivalently, we say $f$ has a pole at $z_0$ if $f$ is holomorphic in a deleted neighborhood of $z_0$ and $\lim_{z\rightarrow z_0} f(z) = \infty$. 

Every pole has an order $n$. We say a pole $z_0$ is simple if $n=1$.
